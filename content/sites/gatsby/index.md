Gatsby is a modern web framework for blazing fast websites.

- **Go Beyond Static Websites.** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the
  limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps so you can create high-quality,
  dynamic web apps, from blogs to e-commerce sites to user dashboards.

- **Use a Modern Stack for Every Site.** No matter where the data comes from, Gatsby sites are
  built using React and GraphQL. Build a uniform workflow for you and your team, regardless of
  whether the data is coming from the same backend.

- **Load Data From Anywhere.** Gatsby pulls in data from any data source, whether it’s Markdown
  files, a headless CMS like Contentful or WordPress, or a REST or GraphQL API. Use source plugins
  to load your data, then develop using Gatsby’s uniform GraphQL interface.

- **Performance Is Baked In.** Ace your performance audits by default. Gatsby automates code
  splitting, image optimization, inlining critical styles, lazy-loading, prefetching resources,
  and more to ensure your site is fast — no manual tuning required.

- **Host at Scale for Pennies.** Gatsby sites don’t require servers so you can host your entire
  site on a CDN for a fraction of the cost of a server-rendered site. Many Gatsby sites can be
  hosted entirely free on services like GitHub Pages and Netlify.
