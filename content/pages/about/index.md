## About JavaScript Framework

JavaScript Framework is a leaderboard of the top JavaScript frameworks and libraries. It's run by [Cosmic](https://www.cosmic.com), a headless CMS to power content for any website or app, as a resource for those looking for options for the best JavaScript framework. The site itself is built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and is built and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). You can check out the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/cosmicjs/javascriptframework) and contributions are [more than welcome](/contribute)!

By using a JavaScript framework, you can build on the work that someone else has done. Leveraging the open source community, many popular tools have been developed in the JavaScript community to help developers build applications.

Using a [Headless CMS](https://www.cosmicjs.com/headless-cms) to manage content in your JavaScript application deployed to a [Static Website Hosting](https://www.staticwebsitehosting.org/) provider, you have the option for a modern development stack that is powerful, performant, and secure.
