## Contributing

Everybody is welcome to contribute to JavaScript Framework, just fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cosmicjs/javascriptframework) and send a pull request.
Each JavaScript framework is a `index.md` markdown file in the `content/sites/<name>/` directory.

Make sure to follow the following rules:

- **JavaScript Framework:** Can be a full framework or library utility.
- **Stick to the format:** Fill out all the same fields as the other JavaScript frameworks in `content/sites`.
- **Short description:** Keep all the details for the body text, keep the description for the overview page short and sweet.
